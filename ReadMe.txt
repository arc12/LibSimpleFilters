A collection of simple filters intended for use with sensor data that is sampled at regular time intervals.
*NOT system control (e.g. Kalman)
*NOT audio waveform (although they can be used to get a measure of current loudness.

Simple enough to understand what they are doing, hence when to apply them (for me).

The philosophy is one of basic understanding of the filter properties with some empirical testing and variation of parameters.
